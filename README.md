# Greenhouse Gas Emissions Prediction 
AI-based project for predicting greenhouse gas emissions as part of my internship work.
This repository contains my project work for the AICTE-Edunet-Shell 4-week internship under the Skills4Future Green Skills using AI program. The goal of this project is to build an AI/ML-based model to predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability and climate awareness through data-driven solutions.
